<h1>D&D Mobile App</h1>
<article>
  <p>Hello, welcome to the repository for a progressive web app (PWA) I'm building! The goal for this project is to make a mobile companion app for Dungeons & Dragons. It will allow the user to search and filter for monsters, view their statblocks, and save them to collections. </p>

  <h2>How to use?</h2>
  <p>You can run the app by dragging the index.html file into your browser. The end goal of the project is to turn it into a PWA that can be downloaded on both desktop and mobile platforms.</p>
